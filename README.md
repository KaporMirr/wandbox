### jBatch

jBatch developer, Boris Schaeling says:

[jBatch](http://iomash.com/) comes with a `wandbox` command to access the API more easily. To compile and run a Python program with Wandbox and append the program's output to a webpage, use:

```
<script type="text/jbatch">
  wandbox run --compiler python-2.7.3 --code 'print("Hello, world!")' | appendTo body
</script>
```

See [CodePen](http://codepen.io/iomash/pen/KwBEJG) for Wandbox with jBatch in action.
